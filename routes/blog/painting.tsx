      <H1>Can I become an artist?</H1>
      <S>
        <P>
          In July of 2025 I had a heated discussion with a retired arts dealer. I asked my
          typical questions about "who decides what is art?" and "who decides how much an
          art piece costs?". The art dealer`s response was "I do that!"
        </P>

        <P>
          The answer provoked and frustrated me.

        <H3>23. august 2025 - first attempt</H3>
        <p>
          After thinking about this painting thing for a few weeks, and seeing my
          girlfriend draw a little, I thought I would give it a go. Around the same time,
          posts from the Portuguese artist{' '}
          <a href='https://www.instagram.com/_francis.co/'>Francisco Fonseca</a>{' '}
          started appearing in my social feed, and I got inspired by his paintings of old
          buildings. I bought a water color set and a few pens. I found a picture I took
          from Mondovi in Piemonte earlier in the summer with lots of buildings on it.
          During the process of sketching out the scene, I got too impatient and wanted to
          see how it looked with colors. I never got to finish it, but I liked the style.

        <H3>23. august 2025 - second attempt</H3>
        <p>
          I wanted to finish a painting, so I tested out painting a door from our village
          Perinaldo which I managed to finish. Tested adding some shadows and splatterings
          of paint. The perspective was totally off, but the entire process took just a
          few minutes. I was hooked.

        <H3>26. august 2025 - finishing the funicular in Mondovi</H3>
        <p>
          I had another attempt at the scene from Mondovi with a focus on perspectives
          this time. The buildings did not end up looking as good this time, and I left
          too much ink on the paper. The perspective was also totally off in places. Very
          limited shadow work.

        <H3>27. august 2025 - painting our house</H3>
        <p>
          It was a nice late summer day and I thought I would have another go at
          perspective drawing. I got the wall, window and porch dialed in, but the stair
          case, wheel barrel and rake was off. I was very happy with the tree. Tried some
          more shading. Starting to look like illustrations in a childrens book now.

        <H3>1. september 2025 - centro storico in Perinaldo</H3>
        <p>
          Off to Italy and Perinaldo. Our village has a ton of fantastic old buildings so
          it should not be hard to find anything to paint. This is from the church piazza
          in the historic center of the town. My first attempt at the typical italian
          building with green shutters and the ligurian color palette. Quite happy with
          the almost invisible shading and perspective that gave the building some depth.

        <H3>2. september 2025 - shit did I make this?!</H3>
        <p>
          This is the moment where I thought "shit, did I make this???" - the perspective,
          light, shadows, cold tones, warm tones, buildings and a human figure -
          everything suddenly came together. This was also the moment I understood how
          difficult painting people is. Your brain is so incredibly good at recognizing
          people, and if the proportions or the balance is just a tiny bit off, you will
          see the error immediately. In this case, the balance of the figure is a little
          off. To finish off the painting I used a white pen for highlights and
          reflections.

        <H3>5. september 2025 - view from the bar</H3>
        <p>
          I wanted to test out making a quick pen drawing without sketching with a pencil
          first. The perspective is totally off and I left too much ink on the paper. But
          it has some kind of naive quality to it anyway. It makes me happy looking at it.
          It is also the view from our village bar that I see every morning and afternoon.

        <H3>6. september 2025 - perspectives gotten right</H3>
        <p>
          After messing up the perspectives in the drawing the day before, I thought I
          would try and do it properly. I sat in place and made a pencil sketch. Took a
          picture, and went home to finish it. Very happy with the perspective and the
          shadows in the window sills. The other shadows I messed up.

        <H3>10. september 2025 - a more cartoony style with perspectives off</H3>
        <p>
          I wanted to test out painting a building in a little more cartoonish style with
          the perspectives deliberately a little bit off. I was very happy with this, but
          the coloring is not too good - you can clearly see the brush strokes. I would
          like the coloring to appear a little more random and organic.

        <H3>17. september 2025 - messing up light and shadow</H3>
        <p>
          This scene had such great light, shadow and colors, but I totally missed the
          mark on this one. I also need to learn how to paint plants. But the coloring of
          the walls was not too bad.

        <H3>22. september 2025 - roof tiles, people, shadows and reflections</H3>
        <p>
          Allright! I was super happy with this one. I got the shadows more or less
          correct, painted roof tiles for an hour (crap, a lot), got the human figures
          placed into the correct perspective with an ok balance and proportions. The
          ground was wet, and I tried to paint reflections onto the ground - not too bad.
          I also used a white marker for highlights and reflections. The bike did not look
          good - have to get back to that.

        <H3>28. september 2025 - more perspectives and structure on walls</H3>
        <p>
          I wanted to see if I could make the walls look more organic with some structure.
          Quite happy with how the wall coloring and structure turned on. The perspective
          of the staircase and the shadows on the shutters and the green door was also
          nice. But again, I put too much ink on the page. I need to get a thinner pen, a
          brown one.

        <H3>7. october 2025 - bigger format and more details</H3>
        <p>
          Moving away from my sketchbook I wanted to check out bigger formats and more
          detail. This is an unfinished sketch of the old town of Menton, France. I was
          happy with the level of detail and the perspective of the buildings. I messed up
          the front of the church, but it is not really noticable.

        <H3>8. october 2025 - coloring was a mistake</H3>
        <p>
          I added a missing piece and a couple of trees in the top right corner and was
          very happy with the trees (I can do trees now). However, coloring the scene was
          a total mistake. It looked a lot better as a black and white pen drawing.

        <H3>9. october 2025 - painting a leaf in 30 minutes</H3>
        <p>
          After spending several days with all those details from Menton, and not being
          happy after coloring it, I picked up a leaf from the street and painted it.
          Added a shadow for depth. It took about 30 minutes. Again I thought "did I make
          this???"

        <H3>12. october 2025 - messing up light and shadow again!</H3>
        <p>
          Inspired by the painting of the leaf a few days earlier and the amazing autumn
          colors, I wanted to have another go at trying to capture light and shadow. And I
          totally messed it up again. Yuk! But I liked the tree.

        <H3>13. october 2025 - making shadows using alkohol markers</H3>
        <p>
          I had bought some alcohol markers that I had not tried out yet. So I made a
          quick pen sketch of a building with some awnings on it and well defined shadows.
          That worked out quite well. You really do not notice the shadows being there,
          the image just feels right. Your brain is convinced.

        <H3>23. october 2025 - and then there was finally light and shadow</H3>
        <p>
          A few days earlier I took my mountain bike to the woods between San Romolo and
          Bajardo. The forest road was totally covered with brown leafs and the light was
          amazing. I took a photo of my bike and thought I would have another go at
          capturing the light in a painting. This time it worked. Super happy! The bike
          also looked ok. And oh, do you see the small shadow underneath the wheels?
          Without those tiny shadows, the bike was just floating in the air. You can`t
          fool the brain.
